Advance Data Science 

Implemented Word Vector and Pre-Processing of Data.

Pre-Processing of Data
In data pre-processing I have implemented data cleaning, removing the null values so that the dataset is consistent.
After that I have calculated the accuracy score using different methods then compared it in the table form and in the visualization form.

Word Vector.
In Word Vector we learned what is word vector and what is the concept behind it. We have implemented different ways in which the word
vectors can be implemeted and also found out the quality score for the same.
